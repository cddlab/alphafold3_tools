# alphafold3_tools

Toolkit for alphafold3 input generation and output analysis.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or later

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using python3.12, create and activate venv at first.
> `/path/to/workingdirectory` is your working directory.
>
> ```bash
> mkdir -p /path/to/workingdirectory ; cd /path/to/workingdirectory`
> python3.12 -m venv ~/.venv
> source .venv/bin/activate
> ```

```bash
# Ubuntu 22.04 uses python3.10 by default. Use python3.12 if you have it instead of python3.10.
# install from GitHub
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/cddlab/alphafold3_tools.git
# upgrade
python3 -m pip uninstall alphafold3_tools -y && python3.10 -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/cddlab/alphafold3_tools.git
```

On Ubuntu, the commands will be installed in `~/.local/bin` or in the `.venv` directory (e.g. `/path/to/workingdirectory/.venv/bin`). You may need to add this directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

## Usage

More detailed usage information can be found by running the commands with the `-h` option.

`msatojson` is a command to convert an a3m-formatted multiple sequence alignment (MSA) file to JSON format. The input name can be specified with the `-n` option.

```bash
msatojson -i input.a3m -o input.json -n inputname
```

The input a3m MSA file can be generated by MMSeqs2 webserver (or ColabFold). `colabfold_batch --msa-only` option is useful to generate a3m MSA files only.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently including templates is not supported. I am working on it.

`paeplot` is a command to plot the predicted aligned error (PAE). The color map can be specified with the `-c` option. The default color map is `bwr` (ColabFold-like), but `Greens_r` is also available for AlphaFold Structure Database (AFDB)-like coloring.

```bash
paeplot -i /path/to/alphafold3_output/directory -c Greens_r --dpi 300
```

`sdf2ccd` is a command to convert sdf file to ccd format.

```bash
sdf2ccd -i input.sdf -o output.ccd -n STR
```

Other tools are being developed and will be added soon.
